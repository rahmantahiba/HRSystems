# What is the purpose of the project?

The purpose of this project is to develop a salary tracking system for managing employee compensation over a five-year period. The system will be used by customers (employers) to:

1) Track Employee Information: Maintain records of employees, their positions, and the wage bands (112A–117A) they are hired into.

2) Monitor Salary Progression: Calculate and display each employee's current salary, and project annual salary changes over the next five years based on yearly performance evaluations.

3) Budget Salary Increases: Provide yearly projections of the total salary budget, incorporating individual performance-based salary increases (ranging from 0% to 3%).

4) Flag Wage Band Exceedance: Identify and alert the customer if an employee’s salary is projected to exceed the maximum of their assigned wage band within the next five years, assuming they consistently receive an average performance score (score of 3 or higher).
